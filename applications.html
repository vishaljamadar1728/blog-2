      <h2>Key Applications of AI & Machine Learning in Network Security</h2>
      <p>AI and ML are no longer futuristic concepts—they are actively deployed across the entire cyber kill chain. Below are the most impactful, production-grade use cases in 2025.</p>
    </main>

    <br>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>1. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)</h3>
      <p>ML models build dynamic behavioral baselines for every user, device, service account, and workload. Any deviation (e.g., impossible travel, unusual data exfiltration patterns, lateral movement) triggers risk scoring and automated response.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detects compromised credentials without relying on malware signatures</li>
        <li>Identifies insider threats and account takeovers in real time</li>
        <li>Reduces mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) from weeks to minutes</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>Modern UEBA platforms achieve >98 % reduction in false positives compared to legacy DLP/IDS rules (Gartner 2024).</blockquote>
    </main>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>2. Next-Generation SIEM & Intelligent SOAR</h3>
      <p>AI-powered Security Information and Event Management systems ingest billions of events daily and use unsupervised learning to surface only the 0.01 % that matter.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Natural Language Querying for analysts</li>
        <li>Automated playbook orchestration (SOAR) triggered by ML risk scores</li>
        <li>False-positive suppression via continual retraining</li>
      </ul>
    </main>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>3. Zero-Day & Polymorphic Malware Detection</h3>
      <p>Deep learning on raw packet bytes, file embeddings, and execution sandboxes detects never-before-seen malware with accuracy rivaling or surpassing human experts.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on network flows</li>
        <li>Transformer-based models (e.g., Microsoft’s DeepGuard, Deep Instinct) achieving 99.8 %+ detection rates on VirusTotal 0/70 samples</li>
      </ul>
    </main>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>4. Automated Threat Hunting</h3>
      <p>Instead of waiting for alerts, reinforcement-learning agents continuously hunt across endpoints, cloud logs, and network telemetry, hypothesizing and validating attack paths.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CrowdStrike Falcon Insight XDR, Microsoft Defender XDR, and Palo Alto Cortex XDR all use autonomous hunting loops</li>
        <li>Hunters now find 10–30× more high-fidelity incidents than rule-based systems</li>
      </ul>
    </main>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>5. Predictive Threat Intelligence & Attack Surface Management</h3>
      <p>Graph neural networks and large language models predict which vulnerabilities will be weaponized next by analyzing dark-web chatter, exploit code similarity, and patch release patterns.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyentia Institute + Recorded Future AI models predict CVE exploitation with ~85 % accuracy up to 60 days in advance</li>
        <li>Automated prioritization of remediation (true EPSS replacement)</li>
      </ul>
    </main>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>6. Deception & Adversarial ML Defense</h3>
      <p>AI-generated honeypots, fake credentials, and decoy workloads that adapt in real time to attacker TTPs (e.g., Attivo Networks, Acalvio, Zscaler Deception).</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, defensive ML models are hardened against adversarial examples (poisoning, evasion attacks) using robust training and ensemble methods.</p>
    </main>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>7. Cloud-Native & SASE/SSE Integration</h3>
      <p>Secure Access Service Edge platforms (Zscaler, Netskope, Cato, Prisma Access) embed real-time ML directly into the data plane, classifying and blocking threats at line rate across millions of users without sending data to central clusters.</p>
    </main>

    <main class="card">
      <h3>8. Phishing & Business Email Compromise (BEC) Defense</h3>
      <p>Transformer models (BERT derivatives) achieve >99.9 % accuracy in detecting impersonation, payload-less attacks, and multilingual phishing by analyzing writing style, context, and relationship graphs.</p>
    </main>

    <br>
    <main class="card">
      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> In 2025, every layer of a modern defense-in-depth architecture—endpoint, network, cloud, identity, email, and data—has an AI/ML-enhanced equivalent that dramatically outperforms its traditional predecessor.</p>
      <p>The question is no longer “Should we adopt AI in security?” but “How fast can we adopt it before our adversaries do?”</p>
