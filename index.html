      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In today's hyper-connected world, cyber threats have become more sophisticated, voluminous, and adaptive than ever before. Traditional signature-based and rule-based security systems are increasingly blind to zero-day exploits, polymorphic malware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and AI-powered attacks launched by adversaries themselves.</p>
      <p>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have emerged as the most powerful force multiplier in modern network security — shifting defense from reactive to proactive, from static rules to continuous learning, and from human-scale analysis to real-time processing of massive data streams.</p>
      <p>AI/ML does not replace existing security layers — it supercharges them, enabling organizations to detect the undetectable, predict attacks before they materialize, and respond at machine speed.</p>

        <h2>What is AI and Machine Learning in Network Security?</h2>
        <p>AI and Machine Learning in Network Security is the strategic application of advanced algorithms, statistical models, and deep learning techniques to protect networks, endpoints, cloud workloads, and data flows from cyber threats.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional tools that rely on known signatures or fixed rules, AI/ML systems continuously learn normal behavior baselines, identify subtle anomalies in real-time, classify never-before-seen threats, predict attack pathways, and in many cases automate containment and remediation.</p>
        <p>Core capabilities include User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), automated threat hunting, intelligent SIEM, next-generation anomaly detection, predictive threat intelligence, and self-healing networks.</p>
